# ML-python-xgb-cpu-service

Quickstart project for executing an Iris classifier using the XGBoost framework on a CPU.

Running `pip install requirements.txt` and then `python app.py` will start the app on localhost where the user can send GET requests to perform inference.

eg .../iris/{index} where index is in the range [0:150]
